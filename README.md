Sample project utilising the Northwind sample database  (https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/sample-data/northwind/).

Using ASP.NET Core MVC for the Front-end and Back-end. 
SQLite3 for database access.
Isolated the database access into its own nuget package to enable reusability when doing a similar project with an Angular front-end and an ASP.NET Core Web Service for the back-end.
